This repository contains various utilities, code snippets, reusable implementations of common specifications and technical standards, and anything else that sounds like it could belong as a utility.

Don't expect anything there to be fully tested. Consider everything here unsafe.

For performance, readability, and brevity, I frequently omit edge-case and limit detection in my own projects where edge cases don't happen and limits are not reached. If you misuse these utilities, your program can break.

Expect few comments. These files should read like English.
